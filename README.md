# RPMgobernor
Software for the RPM Gobernor


## When the company's fleet grew, suddenly the car crashes among them arose, I looked into it and, the fact showed out, speeds over 120Km/hr. Thereby I started to figure out how to solve this. I designed and made an electronic system "RPM Governor" based on a microcontroller. 
This system is connected to each car of the company and its principal aim is to read the engine RPM and also the temperature, the lights' status, battery voltage, and consequence the health of the Alternator. Whether the RPM surpasses 3000 RPM the system produces an alarm alerting the driver whether the driver carries on and the engine transgresses 3250 RPM the system opens a relay and turns off the engine when the RPM is below the threshold the engine is turned on again. If the temperature of the engine is out of a normal level an alarm goes off and turns on the cooler fan, yet the temperature is still increasing the engine is turned off.
 Although it manages other functions, I only want to point out the principals. I design the electronic board, choose and order each of the electronic components (resistors, transistors, capacitors, micro-controller), send the GERBER files to china, and assemble the components by hand myself. I also wrote all the software in C++ and in a very basic IDE which is Arduino IDE. It was my first approach to the marvelous and endless programming world. I learned all the basics with this project. It took me about 6 months and 10 versions to reach the accomplishment, with 3250 RPM the cars can only reach 105km/hr the damage toll and rate of crashes dwindled dramatically.
